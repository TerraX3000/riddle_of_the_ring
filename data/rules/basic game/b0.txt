THE BASIC GAME
The Basic Game is designed for those playing Riddle of the Ring for the first time. The object is to have a good time. Don't be afraid to make a mistake; you will learn from experience.
After you read the information printed on the board and Sections B-1 and B-2, you may want to begin playing immediately. Refer to the rest of the Basic Rules as needed. There is an index at the end of the Basic Rules.
Although you can get started without reading all of the rules, at least one player in each group is encouraged to read all of the rules for the Basic Game. When reading the rules for the first time, refer to the board and the cards. Simply by reading instructions on the cards, players will quickly become familiar with most of the activities in the game.
A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PLAY
Riddle of the Ring can be played by 2 to 8 players. Each player attempts to obtain cards in order to compete with the other players for control of The One True Ring. The Hobbit players must try to take The Ring to the Cracks of Doom (for destruction), while the Black Rider players must try to take it to Barad-d√ªr (to the evil Sauron of Mordor). The first player to accomplish this feat is the winner.
