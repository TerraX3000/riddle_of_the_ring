B-9 FRIENDLY EXCHANGES
When a player stops on, or beside, the space occupied by another player, he must immediately have a Friendly Exchange with that player before anything else is done. The player whose turn it is may not move again, have Power Plays, or do anything else until he has the Exchange.
Each player draws 1 card from the other player's hand so that they swap 1 card in an exchange. If one or both of the players have no cards, there is no exchange.
When a player stops on or beside 2 or more players, he must have a Friendly Exchange with each of them. The player whose turn it is gets to choose the order of having exchanges with the others. The card received from the first exchange is put in his hand before the beginning of the second exchange.
There is no limit to the number of Friendly Exchanges a player may have during his turn by using extra moves. Each time he uses an extra move, such as a Horse card, to stop on or beside a space occupied by another player, a Friendly Exchange must take place. Each Friendly Exchange must take place by moving to a different space than the previous one used.
When cards are held in a fan, the other player draws the card he wants, seeing only the backs of the cards. When the player holds his cards in a stack, the other player says how many cards up from the bottom or down from the top the card he wants is. Examples: Second card from the top, bottom card, etc.
