B-3 HOW TO WIN THE GAME
Hobbit players: For a Hobbit player to win the game, he must first end one of his turns with his marker on the Cracks of Doom space. He does not win on that turn. He wins the game if he can show The Ring card in his hand at any time during his next turn and his marker is on the Cracks of Doom space.
Black Rider players: For a Black Rider player to win the game, he must first end one of his turns with his marker on the Barad-d没r space. He does not win on that turn. He wins the game if he can show The Ring card in his hand at any time during his next turn and his marker is on the Barad- d没r space.
A player may go to his victory space (the Cracks of Doom for Hobbits, Barad-d没r for Black Riders) with or without The Ring card in his hand. If the player has, or can obtain, The Ring at any time during his next turn, he may show it while on the Cracks of Doom (for Hobbits) or Barad-d没r (for Black Riders) and thus win the game.
NOTE: With more than 4 players in a game, we strongly suggest that you use Variations O-1, O-5, or O-6 in the Optional Rules for a shorter game.
